# Build script for building android kernels with GCC
This is my little build script that will help you with building android kernels (with GCC).

# Usage:
```
* git clone https://github.com/R0rt1z2/build_kernel_scripts.git
```

```
* cd build_kernel_scripts
```

```
* git clone yourkernelsource
```

```
* chmod a+x build.sh
```

```
* ./build.sh yourkernelsource
```

Now just enter the asked values and the process will start automatically.
Don't clone any toolchain, the script will do it for you.
